# RainDance
A small project from 2019 attempting to predict water levels with rainfall on the River Dart using a few different ML strategies.
Files are from various stages of the build, some are updates of other and some are different models entirely.
River level and rainfall data pulled from UK Environment Agency API.

**2023 Update:**
New regression model using newly available historic data from Austins bridge station (csv too large for github). Playing around with indicators to find more correlation.
